============
Twitterbot that tweets about skiing and surfing and generally, shredding the gnar. My first foray into Python and the world of APIs.

Carl does a terrible job replying to people - he tries to use a very bad pattern matching algorithm which usually results in him saying short, generic replies.

The next goal is to stick some more advanced content generation into him. Looking into Markov chains as a possibility.
