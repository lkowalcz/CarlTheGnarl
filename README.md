CarlTheGnarl
============
Twitterbot that tweets about skiing and surfing and generally, shredding the gnar. 

Carl was my first foray into Python and the world of APIs. I created him initially to test out a pattern matching algorithm for replies that I had learned.

Unfortunately, Twitter's API change from 1.0 -> 1.1 has really messed him up. I didn't fix him for a while, and he lost a lot of his followers.

I'm now slowing rebuilding him back to his former glory.
