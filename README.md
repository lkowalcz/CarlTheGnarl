CarlTheGnarl
============
Twitterbot that tweets about skiing and surfing and generally, shredding the gnar. My first foray into Python and the world of APIs.

Very very ugly coding for the bot. Trying to rewrite entire thing and use a different API wrapper (the twitter module I used doesn't support retweets. Really? Maybe I'll just add to the wrapper...).
Hopefully I'll find time for the rewrite soon.

Carl does a terrible job replying to people - he tries to use a very bad pattern matching algorithm which usually results in him saying short, generic replies.

The next step after the rewrite is to stick some more advanced content generation into him. Looking into Markov chains as a possibility.
